# `<Project / Feature Name>` — Specification (Full)

> **Template instructions (delete before publishing):**
>
> This is the **Full** spec template — for multi-service systems, data platforms, durable data, external integrations, or multiple stakeholders. Simpler work should use `spec-light-template.md` (scripts, small tools, single-session agent tasks) or `spec-standard-template.md` (typical features and services). See [Appendix D](#appendix-d-tailoring-guide).
>
> 1. Replace `<angle-bracket>` placeholders. Delete guidance blockquotes and "Suggested prompts" lists once used. Delete any section that genuinely does not apply (Stakeholders for solo projects, UI/API for headless services, Compliance when no regime applies) — leave a one-line reason rather than an empty table.
> 2. **Prose-first for narrative sections** (Purpose, Background, Architecture Summary, Recovery); tables only for enumerable facts. Do not fill a table with one-word cells when a paragraph would explain more.
> 3. Requirements must be specific, testable, necessary, feasible, traceable, and unambiguous. Use "The system shall…" for mandatory behavior. Never write "fast," "easy," "robust," or "secure" without a measurable criterion.
> 4. Optional modules in Appendix C (external integrations, scheduled work, entity resolution, scoring) are included **only if the system needs them**. Their examples illustrate the expected _depth_ of detail, **not** the expected architecture — do not copy their shapes into systems that don't need them.
> 5. Diagrams are Mermaid (renders natively in GitHub/GitLab/VS Code/Obsidian). Use only the views that are useful.
>
> **Standards note:** Structure and terminology borrow from ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018 (requirements), IEEE 1016-2009 (design description), and ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022 (architecture description) without claiming formal compliance. Full citations in References. (IEEE 830-1998 is superseded; do not use it as an authority.)

## Revision History

| Version | Date           | Author     | Change        |
| ------- | -------------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| 0.1     | `<YYYY-MM-DD>` | `<author>` | Initial draft |

**Spec lifecycle:** This document is **living until `approved`**, then **change-controlled**: post-approval edits require a new revision row and, for scope-affecting changes, re-approval by the owner. Implementation deviations are recorded in the [Deviations Log](#deviations-log), not silently patched into requirements. When replaced, set `status: superseded` and `superseded_by:` in the frontmatter.

---

## 1. Purpose & Background

Describe, in prose, the problem this software, feature, or subsystem solves.

Include:

- The user, business, operational, or technical problem, and who has it.
- What event, pain point, or opportunity triggered the work now.
- What outcome should exist after successful implementation.
- The intended first-release scope: what is deliberately optimized for now, and what must remain possible later.
- The compounding value or long-term asset, if any (accumulated data history, audit trail, automation reliability, reusable platform capability, reduced toil).

Suggested prompts:

- Who needs this system, and what job are they trying to complete?
- Why are existing tools insufficient?
- What must the MVP accomplish without overbuilding?
- What future directions should not be blocked by early design choices?

Example framing:

> This project provides `<capability>` so that `<user/system>` can `<desired outcome>` without `<current pain or failure mode>`.

---

## 2. Scope

### 2.1 In Scope

- `<included capability>`
- `<included workflow>`
- `<included integration>`

### 2.2 Out of Scope (Non-Goals — never)

Things this system is **intentionally never** going to do. The reason column prevents relitigating the exclusion later.

| ID     | Non-Goal                                 | Reason  |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------- | ------- |
| NG-001 | `<thing we are intentionally not doing>` | `<why>` |

### 2.3 Won't Have in v1 (deferred — not never)

Things that are goals eventually but **excluded from this release** to control scope. Distinct from Non-Goals: these have a revisit trigger.

| ID | Deferred Capability | Why Deferred | Revisit When |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| WH-001 | `<feature deferred to avoid scope creep>` | `<cost, risk, uncertainty, missing validation>` | `<trigger: milestone, metric, user demand, date>` |

### 2.4 Boundaries

| Boundary | Description |
| --- | --- |
| System owns | `<data, behavior, APIs, jobs, UI, files>` |
| System depends on | `<external services, databases, queues, hardware, user actions>` |
| System does not own | `<systems, data, decisions, or processes outside this scope>` |

---

## 3. Context

### 3.1 Current State

Describe the existing implementation, workflow, or operating environment: systems involved, known limitations, relevant prior decisions, operational constraints, known failure modes.

### 3.2 Target State

Describe the desired end state after this work is complete.

### 3.3 Assumptions

| ID    | Assumption     | Impact if False                          |
| ----- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| A-001 | `<assumption>` | `<what breaks and what we'd do instead>` |

### 3.4 Constraints

| ID | Constraint | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| C-001 | `<technical, business, legal, operational, security, schedule, hosting, compatibility, or tooling constraint>` | `<who or what imposes it>` |

---

## 4. Goals

Goals are outcomes; requirements (§7) are behaviors. A goal should be traceable to the requirements that achieve it.

| ID    | Goal     | Success Signal        | Achieved By    |
| ----- | -------- | --------------------- | -------------- |
| G-001 | `<goal>` | `<observable result>` | `<FR/NFR ids>` |

---

## 5. Stakeholders and Users

> Skippable for solo/single-user projects — delete rather than filling with one person's name four times.

| Role / Stakeholder | Concern | Involvement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<end user>` | `<usability, correctness, workflow>` | `<uses system / approves release>` |
| `<operator>` | `<deployment, monitoring, recovery>` | `<maintains system>` |
| `<developer>` | `<implementation, extensibility>` | `<builds and changes system>` |
| `<security reviewer>` | `<risk, access, secrets, compliance>` | `<reviews design>` |

---

## 6. Glossary

Define every domain term an implementer could misread. Ambiguous terminology is a top source of requirement misinterpretation — by coding agents especially.

| Term     | Definition             | Notes / Not to be confused with |
| -------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `<term>` | `<precise definition>` | `<disambiguation>`              |

---

## 7. Requirements

> **Quality rule:** Each requirement is one testable statement with a stable ID, a rationale, an acceptance criterion, and a priority. Priorities: **Must** (release-blocking), **Should** (important, briefly deferrable), **Could** (nice-to-have, must not delay release). Anything "Won't" belongs in §2.3, not here.

### 7.1 Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Rationale | Acceptance Criteria | Priority |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FR-001 | The system shall `<specific behavior>`. | `<why this exists>` | `<how to verify it>` | Must |
| FR-002 | The system shall `<specific behavior>`. | `<why this exists>` | `<how to verify it>` | Should |

### 7.2 Non-Functional Requirements

Quality attributes: performance, reliability, maintainability, usability, observability, portability, compatibility, scalability.

| ID | Category | Requirement | Measurement / Acceptance Criteria | Priority |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| NFR-001 | Performance | The system shall `<requirement>`. | `<measurable threshold>` | Must |
| NFR-002 | Reliability | The system shall `<requirement>`. | `<measurable threshold or behavior>` | Must |
| NFR-003 | Observability | The system shall `<logging/metrics/tracing/audit requirement>`. | `<observable evidence>` | Should |

### 7.3 Interface Requirements

APIs, CLIs, UIs, files, databases, queues, protocols, external systems, hardware.

| ID | Interface | Requirement | Contract / Format | Acceptance Criteria |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| IR-001 | `<HTTP API / CLI / file / DB / external service>` | The system shall `<interface behavior>`. | `<OpenAPI path, command syntax, schema, protocol>` | `<verification>` |

If the system exposes or consumes an HTTP API: provide or reference an OpenAPI document; define request/response schemas, error responses, authentication and authorization behavior; define pagination, filtering, sorting, and versioning if applicable.

### 7.4 Data Requirements

| ID | Data Entity | Requirement | Validation Rules | Ownership |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DR-001 | `<entity>` | The system shall `<store, read, transform, retain, delete, or validate>`. | `<rules>` | `<owning system>` |

Cover where applicable: schema changes, migrations, retention, backup/restore expectations, privacy classification, import/export, idempotency, audit trail.

---

## 8. Architecture and Design

### 8.1 Architecture Summary

Describe the proposed architecture **in plain prose**: major components, data flow, control flow, runtime boundaries, trust boundaries, external dependencies, and the two or three decisions that most shaped the design (reference §8.3).

### 8.2 Architecture Views

Use only the views that are useful for this project.

#### 8.2.1 Context View

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    User[User / Actor] --> System[This System]
    System --> External[External System]
    System --> Secrets[Secrets Provider]
    System --> Monitoring[Monitoring / Alerting]
```

#### 8.2.2 Container / Deployment View

Deployable units: services, databases, workers, containers, VMs, LXCs, queues, storage.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Client[Client] --> App[Web / API Service]
    App --> Domain[Domain Services]
    Worker[Background Worker] --> Domain
    Domain --> DB[(Primary Datastore)]
    Worker --> ExternalAPI[External API]
```

#### 8.2.3 Component View

| Component | Responsibility | Interfaces | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<component>` | `<what it owns>` | `<HTTP, CLI, queue, DB repository, SDK, webhook>` | `<failure behavior, scaling, key constraints>` |

Guidance: keep domain logic separate from framework glue where practical; make integration-specific code replaceable through interfaces or adapters; document any intentionally accepted coupling.

### 8.3 Design Decisions

| ID | Decision | Rationale | Alternatives Considered | ADR |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| D-001 | `<decision>` | `<why>` | `<alternatives and why rejected>` | `adr-0001-repo-short-title` |

### 8.4 Solution Alternatives Considered

Solution-level alternatives (buy vs. build, existing tool X, prior architecture Y) — distinct from the per-decision alternatives above. One row each prevents relitigating.

| Alternative                           | Why Rejected                   |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `<existing tool / SaaS / do-nothing>` | `<gap, cost, risk, licensing>` |

### 8.5 Design Constraints

Constraints the implementer must not violate:

- `<constraint>`

### 8.6 Dependency Policy

| Dependency               | Allowed?               | Reason  |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------- | ------- |
| `<library/service/tool>` | Yes / No / Conditional | `<why>` |

> Agents: introducing a dependency not listed here requires an OQ- entry and owner approval — see Appendix B.

---

## 9. Data Model

Define persistent storage concretely: schemas or collection/document definitions, migrations, indexes, retention, constraints. Concrete DDL belongs here when the datastore is relational.

Define for each entity:

- natural keys and uniqueness constraints;
- required vs. optional fields;
- normalization rules;
- expected read/write access patterns and the indexes they need;
- what must be stored to reproduce historical results (provenance);
- retention and archival policy;
- future extension fields and why they are safe.

---

## 10. Behavior and Workflows

### 10.1 Primary Workflow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor User
    participant System
    participant Dependency

    User->>System: <action>
    System->>Dependency: <request>
    Dependency-->>System: <response>
    System-->>User: <result>
```

Steps:

1. `<step>`

Expected result:

> `<result>`

### 10.2 Alternate Workflows

| ID     | Trigger       | Behavior     | Expected Result |
| ------ | ------------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| AW-001 | `<condition>` | `<behavior>` | `<result>`      |

### 10.3 Edge Cases

| ID     | Edge Case     | Expected Behavior     |
| ------ | ------------- | --------------------- |
| EC-001 | `<edge case>` | `<expected behavior>` |

### 10.4 State Transitions

Use if the feature has meaningful states (workflows, alerts, approvals, lifecycle).

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Created
    Created --> Active : <trigger>
    Active --> Waiting : <action completed>
    Waiting --> Active : <material change or retry>
    Created --> Suppressed : <user/system suppresses>
    Suppressed --> Created : <suppression expires>
    Created --> Done : <dismiss / cancel / complete>
    Done --> [*]
```

| State     | Meaning     | Entry Condition | Exit Condition |
| --------- | ----------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| `<state>` | `<meaning>` | `<condition>`   | `<condition>`  |

For stateful automation, also define: trigger conditions, deduplication fingerprint fields, cooldown/hysteresis/escalation behavior, supported user actions, audit records, expiry and cleanup rules.

---

## 11. UI Pages / API Endpoints

> Applies if the system has a UI or API surface. If it has neither, delete this section with a one-line reason.

Minimum user/admin/API surface for the release. API-only products: replace pages with endpoints and contracts.

| Page or Endpoint | Purpose | Key Actions | Authorization |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<dashboard/list>` | `<overview and filtering>` | `<sort, filter, inspect, export>` | `<role/session/API scope>` |
| `<detail>` | `<inspect one entity>` | `<view facts, history, actions>` | `<rule>` |
| `<settings/rules>` | `<configure policies, thresholds>` | `<create, edit, disable>` | `<rule>` |
| `<operations/admin>` | `<inspect jobs, failures, audit trail>` | `<retry, pause, override>` | `<rule>` |

For each, specify: data source and primary query; filters/sorts; empty and error states; pagination strategy; latency target; audit requirements for state-changing actions.

**Accessibility & i18n:** state the target (e.g., WCAG 2.1 AA; single-locale v1 with strings externalized) or explicitly declare it out of scope with a reason.

---

## 12. Error Handling and Recovery

### 12.1 Expected Failures

| ID | Failure Mode | User/System Behavior | Logging / Observability | Recovery |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ERR-001 | `<failure>` | `<what happens>` | `<what is logged/emitted>` | `<retry, rollback, manual repair, fail closed>` |

### 12.2 Retry and Idempotency

- Retried operations: `<operations>` — classify failures as **transient** (retry) vs. **permanent/configuration** (do not retry; alert).
- Non-retried operations: `<operations>`
- Idempotency key / deduplication strategy: `<strategy>`

If the system runs scheduled or high-volume external work, define its throttling, retry caps, and circuit-breaker behavior here.

### 12.3 Rollback / Recovery

Describe, in prose, how to recover from partial failure — what state can be inconsistent, how it is detected, and the repair procedure.

---

## 13. Security and Privacy

### 13.1 Authentication

How users, services, or agents authenticate: `<session auth, SSO, API keys, mutual TLS>`.

### 13.2 Authorization

| Actor / Role | Allowed Actions | Denied Actions |
| ------------ | --------------- | -------------- |
| `<role>`     | `<allowed>`     | `<denied>`     |

### 13.3 Secrets

Store credential **references** here (env var names, secret-manager paths) — never values.

| Secret | Storage Location | Access Pattern | Rotation / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<secret name>` | `<secret manager path / env var>` | `<how used>` | `<rotation expectation>` |

### 13.4 Sensitive Data

| Data | Classification | Storage | Transmission | Retention |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<data>` | public / internal / confidential / restricted | `<storage>` | `<transport>` | `<retention>` |

### 13.5 Threats and Mitigations

| Threat     | Impact     | Mitigation     |
| ---------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| `<threat>` | `<impact>` | `<mitigation>` |

### 13.6 Hardening Checklist

Confirm each item is addressed above or mark N/A with a reason:

- [ ] Cookie/session settings (secure, httponly, samesite, rotation)
- [ ] CSRF/CORS policy and allowed origins
- [ ] Webhook/API signature validation
- [ ] Sensitive-data redaction in logs
- [ ] CI/CD secret handling (never printed, never committed)
- [ ] Network exposure (reverse proxy, private network, firewall, service bindings)
- [ ] Identity-header trust rules if behind an auth proxy
- [ ] Run as non-root; least-privilege filesystem and network access

---

## 14. Capacity and Scale Assumptions

The numbers that drive datastore, indexing, and infrastructure choices. If a choice in §9 depends on volume ("partition if needed"), the expected volume belongs here.

| Dimension | v1 Expectation | Growth Assumption | Design Consequence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Data volume | `<rows/GiB at launch>` | `<rate>` | `<partitioning, archival, none>` |
| Request rate | `<req/s or jobs/day>` | `<rate>` | `<scaling approach>` |
| Concurrency | `<users/workers>` | `<rate>` | `<locking, queueing>` |

---

## 15. Risks

General project risks — schedule, technical, dependency, provider. Security threats live in §13.5; provider-specific risk in Appendix C.1 if used.

| ID | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R-001 | `<risk>` | Low / Med / High | Low / Med / High | `<mitigation or acceptance>` | `<owner>` |

---

## 16. Compliance, Licensing, and Data Rights

> Include if any regulatory, licensing, or data-rights obligation applies. Otherwise delete with a one-line reason.

- [ ] Third-party API terms of service reviewed (rate limits, caching, redistribution)
- [ ] Scraped/ingested data rights confirmed
- [ ] OSS license compatibility of dependencies checked
- [ ] PII/regulatory regimes identified (`<GDPR, HIPAA, none>`) and handling defined in §13.4
- [ ] Export/retention obligations recorded in §7.4

---

## 17. Testing and Acceptance

### 17.1 Definition of Done

- [ ] All **Must** requirements implemented; acceptance criteria pass.
- [ ] Automated tests cover required behavior, error cases, and edge cases.
- [ ] Traceability matrix (§17.3) complete — every Must/Should requirement maps to a passing verification.
- [ ] Documentation deliverables (§18.7) produced.
- [ ] Security-sensitive behavior reviewed; hardening checklist (§13.6) resolved.
- [ ] Deviations Log reviewed and accepted by owner.
- [ ] No known blocking defects.

### 17.2 Test Strategy

| Layer | Scope | Required Coverage | Required? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Unit / domain | `<pure logic, validation, permissions>` | `<critical branches and edge cases>` | Yes / No |
| Integration / adapter | `<external APIs, parsers, webhooks, imports>` | `<success, retry, malformed input, rate limits>` | Yes / No |
| Snapshot / contract | `<normalized output, API schemas>` | `<diffs reviewed intentionally>` | Yes / No |
| Database | `<migrations, constraints, repositories>` | `<empty DB and upgrade path>` | Yes / No |
| End-to-end | `<primary user journey>` | `<happy path + one failure path>` | Yes / No |
| Security | `<auth, permissions, CSRF/signatures, redaction>` | `<critical misuse cases>` | Yes / No |
| Operations | `<deploy, rollback, health, backup restore, alerting>` | `<production-readiness checks>` | Yes / No |
| Regression | `<prior bugs, fragile behavior>` | `<pinned by test>` | Yes / No |

### 17.3 Requirement-to-Test Traceability

The implementer fills this in as the completion evidence ([Appendix B.3](#b3-required-completion-report-verification-gate)).

| Requirement ID | Test / Verification Method | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FR-001 | `<test name, command, or manual check>` | Not Started / Passing / Failing / Blocked |

---

## 18. Deployment and Operations

### 18.1 Runtime Environment

| Item              | Value                                          |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Runtime           | `<Python, Node, Go, …>`                        |
| OS / Platform     | `<Linux, container, LXC, VM, managed service>` |
| Datastore         | `<database>`                                   |
| External services | `<services>`                                   |
| Scheduling        | `<cron, systemd timer, queue, worker>`         |
| Hosting           | `<location/provider>`                          |

Runtime services:

| Service | Purpose | Start Mode | Health Signal |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<web service>` | `<serve UI/API>` | `<systemd / container / orchestrator>` | `<health endpoint>` |
| `<worker>` | `<background jobs>` | `<service / queue worker>` | `<heartbeat / job records>` |

### 18.2 Configuration

| Setting         | Required? | Default     | Description     |
| --------------- | --------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| `<CONFIG_NAME>` | Yes / No  | `<default>` | `<description>` |

**Environment matrix** — differences between environments (auth mode, data, secrets source, external-service sandboxes):

| Aspect                                    | Dev       | Staging   | Prod      |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| `<secrets source / auth / external APIs>` | `<value>` | `<value>` | `<value>` |

### 18.3 Deployment Flow

1. Trigger: `<merge to main, release tag, manual approval>`
2. CI checks: `<tests, lint, type checks, security checks, build>`
3. Artifact build or source sync.
4. Runtime configuration and secret rendering.
5. Database migrations — expand/contract rule where applicable (new columns added before old ones removed; no release depends on a same-release schema drop).
6. Service restart or rollout.
7. Smoke test and health check.
8. Rollback procedure: `<how, and how long it takes>`.

### 18.4 Rollout Controls

Risk-managed exposure, distinct from deploy mechanics:

- Feature flags / kill switches: `<which behaviors are flag-gated; how to disable instantly>`
- Canary / staged rollout: `<percentage or cohort strategy, promotion criteria>`
- Data migration reversibility: `<expand/contract status, backfill rollback>`

### 18.5 Observability

Minimum signals:

- `/healthz` (liveness) and `/readyz` (deploy readiness) or equivalents
- Structured logs with correlation IDs
- Job/run records: every scheduled or background job reports start, finish, status, counts, and failure class
- Metrics: throughput, latency, error rate, and cost
- Dead-man heartbeat for scheduled jobs (alert on _absence_ of success, not just presence of failure)

| Alert | Trigger | Severity | Owner / Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<alert>` | `<precise condition>` | Info / Warning / Critical | `<who responds; runbook link>` |

### 18.6 Backup and Disaster Recovery

> Required if the system owns durable data. If it owns none, delete this section with a one-line reason.

**RPO (max acceptable data loss):** `<duration>` · **RTO (max acceptable restore time):** `<duration>`

| Asset | Backup Method | Frequency | Retention | Restore Test Cadence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<database>` | `<dump, snapshot, WAL/PITR>` | `<frequency>` | `<retention>` | `<cadence + owner>` |
| `<files/artifacts>` | `<method>` | `<frequency>` | `<retention>` | `<cadence>` |

Also define: encryption requirements; disaster scenarios covered; scenarios explicitly **not** covered in v1.

### 18.7 Documentation Deliverables

Checklist tied to the DoD:

- [ ] README / user-facing docs updated
- [ ] Runbooks: deploy, rollback, incident response, backup restore, secret rotation
- [ ] Configuration reference (§18.2) matches shipped defaults
- [ ] Handoff/state docs updated per repo convention

---

## 19. Implementation Plan

Break the work into ordered milestones with observable exit criteria. Each step should be actionable by an implementer without inventing sequencing. Scale the ladder to the project — a small tool may need only MS-0–MS-2.

### Waves

> For breadth that ships incrementally. Delete if the work is a single coherent milestone ladder.

| Wave | Scope | Exit Criteria |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Wave 0 | `<smallest end-to-end path, manually seeded data>` | `<proof the skeleton works>` |
| Wave 1 | `<MVP-critical breadth>` | `<minimum production-use criteria>` |
| Later | `<expansion>` | `<criteria for revisiting design>` |

### MS-0 — Foundation

1. Repository/application skeleton and dependency management.
2. Configuration strategy for local and production.
3. Initial schema and migrations.
4. Authentication/authorization baseline.
5. Health/readiness endpoints.
6. CI checks and deployment pipeline.
7. **Demonstrate rollback from a known release.**

### MS-1 — Core workflow

1. First end-to-end input path implemented and persisted.
2. Idempotency/deduplication behavior.
3. Operational run/audit metadata recorded.
4. Tests for success and common failure cases.

### MS-2 — Domain logic

1. Core rules/calculations/decisions implemented.
2. Missing, ambiguous, or low-confidence inputs handled.
3. Decision provenance persisted (see §9).
4. Edge-case and threshold tests.

### MS-3 — User and admin experience

1. Main list/detail surfaces (§11) with pagination, filtering, empty/error states.
2. Configuration/settings flow.
3. State-changing actions with audit trail.

### MS-4 — Automation / notifications / external actions `[if applicable]`

1. Trigger loop with deduplication fingerprint ledger.
2. Cooldown, retry, and suppression rules.
3. Delivery/action status tracking; duplicate and stale-action tests.

### MS-5 — Hardening and production readiness

1. Monitoring and alerting wired (§18.5).
2. Backups wired; **restore test executed**.
3. Storage/cost/throughput safeguards; load test at expected volume.
4. Runbooks written (§18.7); open blockers closed or explicitly accepted.

### Milestone Summary

| Milestone | Deliverable | Exit Criteria |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MS-0 Foundation | Deployable skeleton | CI passes; deploy works; health checks pass; rollback demonstrated |
| MS-1 Core workflow | First end-to-end path | Input flows to persisted result with observability |
| MS-2 Domain logic | Decisions complete | Results reproducible, explained, tested |
| MS-3 UX/API | Usable interface | Primary user completes MVP tasks without developer intervention |
| MS-4 Automation | Action loop | Deduped, observable, auditable actions in production-like environment |
| MS-5 Production readiness | Hardening | Restore tested; monitoring active; blockers closed or accepted |

---

## 20. Success Evaluation

Post-launch evaluation targets, defined **before** implementation. Measured after MS-5.

| Area | Target | Measurement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Functional correctness | `<Must requirements satisfied in production>` | `<tests, acceptance, production checks>` |
| Reliability | `<freshness/availability target>` | `<health checks, run records, uptime>` |
| Performance | `<latency/throughput target>` | `<metrics, load tests>` |
| Cost control | `<budget>` | `<budget counters and alerts>` |
| Operational usability | `<failures visible and actionable>` | `<dashboards, alerts, runbook use>` |

---

## 21. Open Questions and Decisions

Questions may proceed on a recorded **current assumption** unless marked blocking. Blocking questions halt the affected work until answered ([Appendix B.1](#b1-implementation-rules)).

| ID | Question | Current Assumption | Blocking? | Owner | Needed By | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OQ-001 | `<question>` | `<assumption this spec proceeds on>` | Yes / No | `<owner>` | `<milestone/date>` | Open / Answered / Deferred |

---

## Deviations Log

Maintained by the **implementer** during the build ([Appendix B](#appendix-b-agent-implementation-contract)). Any divergence from this spec is recorded here — never silently patched into requirements text.

| ID | Spec Reference | Deviation | Reason | Approved? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DEV-001 | `<FR-xxx / §n>` | `<what was done differently>` | `<why>` | Yes / No / Pending |

## Appendix A: ID Conventions

Stable IDs allow requirements to be referenced from commits, tests, issues, ADRs, and review comments — and let an implementer's completion claims be mechanically checked.

## Appendix B: Agent Implementation Contract

Binding when this spec is implemented by a coding agent. (Applies equally well to human contractors.)

### B.1 Implementation Rules

The implementer shall:

- Read this entire specification before making changes; per session thereafter, re-read at minimum §7 (Requirements), §21 (Open Questions), and the Deviations Log — Background and References may be read once.
- Preserve all explicit non-goals, won't-haves, constraints, and design constraints.
- Treat **Must** requirements as mandatory and **blocking** open questions as hard stops for the affected work.
- On encountering underspecified behavior: file an `OQ-` row **with a proposed default assumption** and proceed on it only if non-blocking — never guess silently.
- On any divergence from the spec: record a `DEV-` row (spec reference, what, why) rather than adapting silently.
- Add or update tests for every implemented requirement; keep §17.3 (traceability) current.
- Follow the milestone order in §19; do not build later milestones on unproven earlier ones.
- Prefer small, reviewable changes; avoid broad refactors unless the spec requires them.
- Document any discovered mismatch between the spec and existing code as a `DEV-` or `OQ-` row.

### B.2 Prohibited Behaviors

The implementer shall not:

- Invent requirements not present in this spec.
- Remove existing behavior unless explicitly required.
- Introduce external services or dependencies outside §8.6 without an approved `OQ-`.
- Store secrets in source control or print them in CI logs.
- Ignore failing tests unrelated to the change without documenting them.
- Treat examples (including Appendix C) as exhaustive or normative unless explicitly stated.
- Mark a requirement complete without a verification entry in §17.3.

### B.3 Required Completion Report (verification gate)

At completion, provide:

- Summary of changes and files changed.
- **Requirements implemented, each mapped to the test or command that proves it** — i.e., the completed §17.3 matrix. Claims without verification entries are not accepted.
- Tests added or changed.
- Deviations (`DEV-` rows) and their approval status.
- Known limitations and remaining open questions.
- Documentation deliverables completed (§18.7).

### B.4 Session Handoff

For multi-session implementations: record current milestone, in-progress requirement IDs, and unresolved `OQ-`/`DEV-` items in the repository's session-state/handoff documents at the end of each session, per the repo's documentation convention. The spec records _what and why_; handoff docs record _where work stands_.

---

## Appendix C: Optional Modules

> Include a module only if the system needs it; delete the rest. **Examples show the expected depth of detail — they are not normative architecture.** Do not copy these shapes into systems that don't need them.

### C.1 External Data Integration

For systems that ingest or emit external data.

| Integration/Source | Purpose | Access Method | Frequency/Trigger | Risk (rate limits, cost, ToS, credentials) | Priority |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<source>` | `<data or action>` | `<API, webhook, file import, SDK>` | `<cadence or event>` | `<risk notes>` | Must / Should / Could |

Adapter contract shape:

```text
interface IntegrationAdapter:
    name, version, capabilities
    fetch(context) -> RawBatch
    validate(raw) -> ValidationResult
    normalize(raw) -> list[NormalizedRecord]
    persist(records) -> PersistResult
    report_health(result) -> RunRecord
```

Per adapter, specify: authentication and secret names; request budget, cost model, retry policy; raw-payload retention; schema-validation approach; duplicate/identity handling; failure isolation from other integrations.

### C.2 Scheduled Work, Throttling, and Circuit Breaker

For recurring jobs, polling, or rate-limited providers.

```yaml
<job_name>:
  enabled: true
  cadence_seconds: <int>
  jitter_percent: <int>
  max_concurrency: <int>
  rate_per_minute: <number>
  daily_call_cap: <int or null>
  monthly_cost_cap: <amount or null>
  retry_policy:
    max_attempts: <int>
    backoff: <fixed | exponential | provider-retry-after>
  circuit_breaker:
    failure_threshold: <int>
    rolling_window_minutes: <int>
    cooldown_minutes: <int>
    half_open_probe_count: <int>
```

Define: what counts as transient vs. permanent failure; when a job is paused; how recovery probes run; who is notified and where status is visible.

### C.3 Identity / Entity Resolution

For merging messy records or mapping external records to internal entities. Progressive ladder — stop at the first rung that meets the need:

1. Normalize aliases, casing, units, formats, identifiers.
2. Match exact known identifiers.
3. Deterministic rules for high-confidence cases.
4. Fuzzy/probabilistic matching **only** with confidence scores and a review path.
5. Route ambiguous records to manual correction.
6. Store match confidence and provenance, not only the final ID.

Rules: never let critical automation depend on untrusted free text unless reviewed; filter/score/alert on normalized fields; persist enough provenance to explain and reverse a bad match.

### C.4 Scoring / Ranking / Decision Logic

For any algorithm that ranks, scores, approves, rejects, or triggers actions.

| Input     | Source                               | Required? | Validation / Fallback |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ | --------- | --------------------- |
| `<input>` | `<field, provider, config, derived>` | Yes / No  | `<notes>`             |

| Component | Weight | Notes |
| --- | --: | --- |
| `<component score>` | `<％>` | `<computation; behavior when unavailable; how explained to users>` |

```text
normalized_metric = <formula>
overall_score = clamp(<lo>, <hi>, <weighted formula> - <risk penalties>)
```

**Every automated decision stores:** input facts used; algorithm version; thresholds and margins; confidence; risk flags; machine-readable explanation payload; user-facing explanation text. (This provenance list applies to _any_ automated decision, including LLM-driven ones — not just numeric scoring.)

### C.5 Relational Schema Examples (depth reference only)

Illustrates the expected level of schema detail — constraints, partial indexes, defaults, access-pattern indexes:

```sql
CREATE TABLE domain_entity (
    id bigserial PRIMARY KEY,
    external_key text,
    name text NOT NULL,
    status text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'active',
    attributes jsonb NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb,
    created_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    updated_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    CONSTRAINT domain_entity_status_check
        CHECK (status IN ('active', 'archived'))
);

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX domain_entity_external_key_uidx
    ON domain_entity (external_key) WHERE external_key IS NOT NULL;

-- Event/observation pattern: provenance + time-ordered access
CREATE TABLE domain_event (
    id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    domain_entity_id bigint NOT NULL REFERENCES domain_entity(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    occurred_at timestamptz NOT NULL,
    record_type text NOT NULL,
    source_payload_hash text,
    source_payload jsonb NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb,
    algorithm_version text,
    created_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);

CREATE INDEX domain_event_entity_time_idx
    ON domain_event (domain_entity_id, occurred_at DESC);

-- Operations pattern: every job run is a queryable record
CREATE TABLE job_run (
    id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    job_name text NOT NULL,
    started_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    finished_at timestamptz,
    status text NOT NULL,
    attempt integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
    result_count integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    failure_class text,
    error text,
    cost_units numeric(12,4) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    metadata jsonb NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb
);

CREATE INDEX job_run_job_time_idx ON job_run (job_name, started_at DESC);
```

## Appendix D: Tailoring Guide

This is the **Full** template. Pick the smallest profile that fits; upgrade if the project grows. A section that genuinely does not apply is deleted with a one-line reason, not left empty.

| Profile | Template File | Use For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Light** | `spec-light-template.md` | Scripts, small tools, single-session agent tasks |
| **Standard** | `spec-standard-template.md` | Typical features and services |
| **Full** | `spec-full-template.md` (this file) | Multi-service systems, data platforms, anything with durable data, external integrations, or multiple stakeholders |

Rules of thumb:

- Owns durable data → §18.6 Backup/DR is required regardless of profile.
- Talks to external paid/rate-limited APIs → C.1 + C.2 + cost rows in §20.
- Makes automated decisions users must trust → C.4's provenance list is required.
- Implemented by a coding agent → Appendix B is required regardless of profile (it is the cheapest section and the highest-leverage one).

Each template is self-contained: if you started in a smaller one and outgrew it, copy your filled-in sections into the larger template and update `profile:` in the frontmatter.
