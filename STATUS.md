# Project Status

This is the human-facing completion summary for the project. Agents maintain it so the project builder can re-orient quickly.

## Completed

- `3.0.0` released on `main` (2026-06-12; tags `v3.0.0`/`v3`; `v2` frozen at `3ece2c9`; GitHub release live).
- Handoff system resynced to engine v3.4 (2026-07-01): SessionStart hooks, `.codex/config.toml`, this file, and `TODO.md`'s section headings brought current; `docs/handoff/specs-plans.md` backfilled to index `docs/superpowers/specs/README.md`.
- Python Tooling standard review + fixes (2026-07-01): the §15 CI-workflow scaffold was invalid YAML (tab-indented) — repaired and byte-locked to the bundle artifact with drift tests; ruff floor raised to `>=0.14` (0.9–0.13 can't run `py314` non-preview); dead `pytest-cov` dropped from all dev groups; adopt CLI now delivers the full `.vscode/` trio (settings/tasks were silently missing); audit-note trail backfilled. 587 tests, 100% coverage.
- **project-spec tooling Spec #1 (read-only) + Spec #2 (`new`) + Spec #3 (`upgrade`) implemented (2026-07-04–05):** full `validate|lint|extract|next|new|upgrade` command surface, reusable `validate-specs.yml`, three fail-closed gates on `upgrade`, byte-exact tier-promotion round-trip oracle.
- **`project-spec` (5th standard) REGISTERED (2026-07-05):** three 🟡 correctness bugs + two 🟢 cleanups from `/code-review high spec` fixed (TDD); adoption docs (`adopt.md`) written in full, including CI wiring for the previously-undocumented `validate-specs.yml` reusable workflow; standard registered — `spec:` config block live, real frontmatter added to README/adopt.md/resources, a dogfood example (`examples/spec.example.md`) added and locked in by its own test, top-level `README.md`/`standards/README.md`/`meta/versioning.md` updated. Five standards now live (was four + one draft).
- **Residual `format-frontmatter`/`cli.py` gaps fixed (2026-07-05):** typo'd `--config` now exits 2 instead of silently formatting under defaults; non-UTF-8 input now reports a clean per-file error instead of a traceback; `validate --help`'s `--glob` text corrected to match real replace-not-additive semantics.
- **`4.0.0` RELEASED on `main` (2026-07-05):** release commit `c7c2fd8`; tags `v4.0.0` + moving `v4`; `v3` frozen at `e69ab6b`; GitHub release live; all 5 CI workflows green. MAJOR (six validator strictness bumps + ruff floor `>=0.14`) shipping project-spec as additive opt-in. Release commit carried the full `meta/versioning.md` checklist: `standards-ref` defaults + every `@v3`→`@v4` doc pin, `UPGRADING.md` rewritten v3→v4, pyproject/lock bump, CHANGELOG `[4.0.0]` migration notes. Cutting also caught pre-existing Prettier/markdownlint drift in two spec-design docs (`testing` never runs format/lint CI) — fixed in `a2fe444`.
- **`4.1.0` + `4.2.0` RELEASED on `main` (2026-07-06):** two additive MINORs. `v4.1.0` (issue #3 F1–F4) — `spec.reference_prefixes` config key + token hygiene (built-in `ADR` prefix, SPDX/license skip), opt-in `spec upgrade --config`. `v4.2.0` (F5, Spec B) — opt-in reusable Prettier gate: `format.yml` made dual-role (`workflow_call` + `prettier: false` job-level opt-out) + adoptable `format.caller.yml`, `markdown_tooling 1.0→1.1`, DEC-9 superseded by DEC-10, repo-local `tests/coherence/` co-satisfaction tool. Spec B implemented via executing-plans (10-task TDD) + scoped opus review (0 Critical/Important; 2 minor fixes applied). Signed tags `v4.1.0@84c0054` / `v4.2.0@6614612`, `v4`→`6614612`, GitHub releases live (v4.2.0 Latest). `main`'s `release-pipeline` ruleset (required signatures) forced a rebase to re-sign 6 unsigned prior-session design commits — identical trees, new tip `6614612`.

## Current State

- **Five standards released, latest `v4.2.0`:** Markdown Frontmatter, ADR, Markdown Tooling (now with an opt-in reusable Prettier gate, `markdown_tooling 1.1`), Python Tooling SSOT, and **Project Specification** (a live CLI, `project-standards spec ...`, with its own reusable CI workflow). **Python Coding** remains the sole in-development draft (unregistered, excluded from validation/adopt).
- `main` and `testing` are in sync at `v4.2.0`; `@v4` (moving) now resolves to `v4.2.0`, with `@v4.2.0`/`@v4.1.0`/`@v4.0.0` frozen; `@v3` stays frozen at `3.0.0`.
- **Sixth standard, CLI Documentation, integrated on `testing` (2026-07-07):** registry (`cli_documentation` 1.0), adopt engine, dogfooded `docs/usage.md`, `--version` on all seven console scripts, and this session's full docs-surface propagation are all in place on `testing`; not yet on `main` — release decision pending.

## Notes For The Builder

- Two informational, explicitly non-blocking items remain in `TODO.md` (`spec new` symlink/TOCTOU edge cases; OpenAPI version pin) — revisit only if their trigger conditions arise.
