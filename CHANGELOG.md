# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.2] — 2026-06-02

### Added

- **Versioning Standard** — `standards/versioning.md` governs how this repository's releases are numbered, tagged, and consumed. Defines the consumer-outcome contract (a release's level reflects the worst-case impact across the standard, schema, validator, and workflow), the per-component MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH classification table, the "previously-passing → now-failing is always MAJOR" rule, and the release requirements (signed full-version tags, the moving major tag, version + changelog bumps). The README `## Versioning` section is now a summary linking to it.

### Changed

- **Repository owner** — transferred from `chrisdpurcell` to the `L3DigitalNet` organization. Updated every in-repo reference to the canonical owner: the reusable workflow's `github.repository` self-identity guards and `uv tool install` URL, the README and `standards/versioning.md` adoption examples, and the JSON Schema `$id`. Not a MAJOR change under the versioning standard — GitHub redirects the old path, so previously-passing consumers continue to pass — but consumers should re-pin `uses:` to `L3DigitalNet/project-standards` rather than rely on the redirect.

## [1.0.1] — 2026-06-02

### Changed

- **CI — reusable validation workflow** — bumped `actions/checkout` (v4 → v6) and `astral-sh/setup-uv` (v5 → v7) so both run on Node 24, clearing the GitHub Actions Node 20 deprecation warning. Scoped uv's dependency cache to this repo via `enable-cache`, since only this repo ships the `uv.lock` the cache keys on; consuming repos (which install the validator with `uv tool install` from git) no longer emit the "cache will never get invalidated" warning. Behaviour-only change to CI plumbing — the validator, schema, and standards are untouched, so `@v1` consumers receive it with no validation impact.
- **Docs** — recommend pinning the reusable workflow and CLI by major tag (`@v1`) for automatic non-breaking fixes; full version tags (`@v1.0.1`) and commit SHAs remain available for immutable pins.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-02

### Added

- **ADR Standard** — Architecture Decision Records using the [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/) format layered on the canonical frontmatter profile.
- `standards/adr.md` — the governing ADR standard: when to write an ADR, MADR body structure (required vs optional sections), the MADR→canonical field and status mappings, ID/filename and `docs/decisions/` directory conventions, and the supersession workflow.
- `templates/adr.md` (full, with explanations) plus `templates/adr-minimal.md`, `templates/adr-bare.md`, and `templates/adr-bare-minimal.md` MADR variants. Replaces the prior simple ADR template.
- `examples/adr.example.md` — converted to MADR structure (PostgreSQL decision), with ADR roles under the `project` namespace.

### Changed

- Clarified scope in `standards/markdown-frontmatter.md`: agent-instruction files (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.claude/`, `.agents/`, `.codex/`) must never carry frontmatter. Updated the README downstream-example config to exclude them.

### Fixed

- Validator exclude patterns now match via `fnmatch` on the file path instead of `Path.glob`, making directory excludes (e.g. `docs/decisions/**`) behave identically across Python versions. Previously such patterns silently failed to exclude nested files on Python ≤3.12, where a trailing `**` matches directories only.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-02

### Added

- **Markdown Frontmatter Standard** — a small, portable, tool-neutral metadata profile for project documentation.
- `standards/markdown-frontmatter.md` — the governing standard: field definitions, controlled values, formatting rules, and extension policy.
- `schemas/markdown-frontmatter.schema.json` — machine-readable JSON Schema (Draft 2020-12); eleven required fields, enum-validated `doc_type`/`status`/`confidence`/`visibility`, `YYYY-MM-DD` date pattern, and `publish`/`project`/`x_project` extension namespaces.
- `templates/` — `frontmatter-minimal.yml`, `frontmatter-standard.yml`, and document templates for note, concept, ADR, runbook, spec, and research types.
- `examples/` — validated worked examples for note, concept, ADR, and runbook documents.
- `tools/validate_frontmatter.py` — CLI validator (files, globs, or config-driven), shipping the bundled schema in the wheel for downstream installs.
- `tests/test_validate_frontmatter.py` — 15 cases covering valid and invalid frontmatter plus config include/exclude behaviour.
- `.github/workflows/validate-markdown-frontmatter.yml` — CI enforcement, reusable via `workflow_call` from downstream repositories.
- `.project-standards.yml` — validator configuration for this repo and the canonical example of the downstream config shape.
